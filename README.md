# Chronopolis 5k Kickblast - Kick Drum Generation Device

Kickblast is a variation off of Beatfox, focusing only on the kick drum synthesizer.

It uses a specialized set of user definable controls to populate a folder full of computer (Csound) generated bass drums.

All you need is a Csound compiler like CsoundQT: https://csoundqt.github.io/

Open the Kickblast.csd file and hit "Run" or "command + R"

You can define a number of parameters up in the top section, including how many kick drums you want to generate.

Enjoy!
